General Notes
-------------

Notification support differs from the Java version in that the notify methods taking
a NotifyHandler and a block, wrap the respective handler and block in an actor, and
so it is safe for client code to take their good time in processing the notification.

It is worth reading about the configuration of Scala's Actor implementation here:

Fly Scala Release History
-------------------------

FlyScala_2.11.2-2.1.6
  Upgrade to scala 2.11

FlyScala_2.10.2-2.0.0
  A major change to the implementation - we've removed it and now just offer a
  wrapper around the Java library to make maintenance simpler.

  com.zink.scala.fly.ScalaFly provides a simply method for finding a Fly server.
  
  com.zink.scala.fly.ScalaFly is a wrapper around a Java Fly instance offering a
  more idiomatic Scala API.

  The ACTOR_MESSAGE has been removed, instead actors will be sent the template
  used when registering the actor for receiving callbacks from the space.
  This will allow you to use an actor for multiple callbacks.

FlyScala_2.9.1-1.3.9
  Made fairly significant performance improvements in the Scala lib

FlyScala-1.3.8: 19 July 2010
  Upgrade to Scala 2.8.0

FlyScala-1.3.7 : 20-3-10
  Create objects (entries) without requiring ctors (Scala compatibility)

FlyScala-1.3.0
  Built with Scala 2.7.7
  Upgraded protocol for Fly Server 1.3

FlyScala-1.2.5 : 23 June 2009
  Fixed a bug in the multiops example
  Made more use of idiomatic scala

FlyScala-1.2.4 : 13 May 2009
  Port number set to IANA port number 
  Support of multicast responder in discovery classes (Finder and Cache)

  Potentially breaking change: target platform is Java 5 JVM + Scala 2.7.4

  BREAKING CHANGES
    Due to port number change both Stubs and Fly server are not backwards
  compatible with previous releases. ( developer@flyobjectspace.com )

    MakeFly has been replaced by FlyFactory

	Interface change in NotiFly to rationalise method naming
	Minor fixes and refactorings

FlyScala 1.1.2 : 14-11-08 
	Improved documentation
	FlyStub implements the Notifly trait entirely with actors so that client code
		does not need to be concerned about

	Ported the stats package from Java to Scala 

FlyScala 1.0.1 : 8-10-08

	Port of FlyJava 1.0.1 with additional support for Actor based notifications in
