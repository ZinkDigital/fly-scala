Getting Started with Fly
------------------------

Welcome to Fly for Scala!  

Fly is an object space server that is specifically written to provide 
lightweight object based messaging between computers running on a network. 

Before you start you need to make sure that have a version of Java and Scala
installed and running on your machine. Type -

> java -version

- into a command prompt or shell. If this fails you will need to download a
recent version of Java SE (1.5 or above) from www.java.com and install this 
onto your machine.

Then test scala with:

> scala -version

If this fails or the version is earlier than Scala 2.8.0, download Scala from
http://www.scala-lang.org/

Unzip the FlyScala download which will create the fly directory.

On windows, double click the startFly.bat file from windows explorer and
 then double click the runExample.bat file. Alternatively type ...

> cd fly
> .\startFly.bat
> cd ..
> .\runExample.bat 

in a windows command prompt. 


On unix systems:

% cd fly
% sh startFly.sh
% cd ..
% sh runExample.sh


In either case, if this successful you will see something like this -

      >      
    <----    
  -------->  
    <----       Fly Server (c)MMVI Zink Digital Ltd. 
      >       Ver 1.2 : LBI 1.2 : Non Commercial License.


Fly Server started on port 4396


and some output from the example code which writes and takes 1000 example 
objects to and from the space server. To write more or less objects, vary the 
final parameter, or try running a number of example clients in parallel.

If you want to see the source for the WriteTake example look in the src 
zip. There are many examples in here of how to use the server via the 
java bindings.

Enjoy using Fly!
